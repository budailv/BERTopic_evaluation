This repository contains code for my Bachelor's thesis experiments on Topic Modeling Algorithms.

To run the experiments, first, you have to install packages from `requirements.txt`.
- If you are using Linux, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you are a Windows user, consider using WSL2 and follow the instruction above or see the Google Colaboraty notebook [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15AffvTeZ8h7Mho8FLHkAz0pzKrKwj6lm?usp=sharing]

After successful installation, run the `Evaluation.ipnyb` notebook from `notebooks` folder.

Results are saved to JSON files. To see the results I got by running the notebook see the Google Drive folder [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oLLP6iejLczMLMayvMzbtSQ9kw5eQ75x?usp=drive_link]

My thesis can be found in the Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LnIaXMw1aDGWe3q1TmmwuJFnebdRt1Bz?usp=drive_link
